                <p><strong>Last updated: October 2025</strong></p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>M0odly ("we," "our," or "the App") provides a social platform for users to share their mood through posts containing a single photo categorized by predefined emotional categories. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect user information, as well as your responsibilities when using the App.</p>

                <h2>2. User-Generated Content (UGC)</h2>
                <p>Users are fully responsible for the content they post in the App. Each post is limited to a single photo and must comply with the following guidelines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users may only post content they have the rights to.</li>
                    <li>Illegal, offensive, or copyrighted content is strictly prohibited.</li>
                    <li>Inappropriate posts may be reported by other users via the "Report" button.</li>
                    <li>Reported posts are reviewed by our administrators and may be removed if they violate our guidelines.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We reserve the right to remove any post and block or delete accounts that violate these rules without prior notice.</p>

                <h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
                <p>We collect minimal data necessary for the operation of the App, including:</p>

                    <li>Email address (if provided)</li>
                    <li>Posts and reports submitted by users</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This information is used for moderation, account management, and to serve advertisements through AdMob. We do not sell personal data to third parties.</p>

                <h2>4. Advertisements</h2>

                    <li>Do not post offensive, illegal, or otherwise prohibited content.</li>
                    <li>Use the reporting system responsibly to flag content that violates the App rules.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By using the App, you acknowledge and accept full responsibility for your posts and interactions within the platform.</p>

                <h2>6. Content Moderation</h2>
                <p>Administrators review reported content and may take the following actions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove posts that violate App guidelines</li>
                    <li>Temporarily or permanently block accounts</li>
                    <li>Delete accounts in cases of repeated or severe violations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All moderation decisions are at the sole discretion of the administrators.</p>

                <h2>7. Security</h2>
                <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect user data, but we cannot guarantee absolute security. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials.</p>

                <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>The App uses AdMob to display advertisements. These services may collect information automatically. We are not responsible for the practices of third-party services. Please review their privacy policies for details.</p>

                <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be notified of significant changes, and continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
